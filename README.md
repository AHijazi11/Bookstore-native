# Bookstore

This project is a bookstore iOS app coded using React Native. Users who visit the bookstore will be able to search for books, select books and view detailed book information. They can also save books to three different lists or “shelves”: 1.) “Want to Read”, 2.) “Currently Reading” and 3.) “Read”. Together, these shelves will make up their “bookshelf”. It includes functionality for users to manage the contents of their bookshelves.
